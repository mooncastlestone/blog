It feels like a month passed by quickly. I'm writing this post to retrospect what I learned in January and see where I can do better.

## English

During this month, I concentrated on studying English because I think I won’t have much time for studying English once I start a new job. So, I thought it’s a good opportunity to improve my weak points in English.

<br />

I decided to study using IELTS materials. IELTS, which stands for International English Language Testing System, is a well-known English certification exam. I chose these materials because they cover a wide range of topics such as politics, history, IT, and environmental issues. This way, I can improve not only English skills but also general knowledge.

<br />

When studying, the most important thing was making a plan. I knew exactly how having a clear plan impacts concentration significantly. Therefore, I always started my day by making a plan.

From February, I’m going to study web development and English at the same time.

## I got to know Mandalart

Ohtani Shohei, who plays in the U.S. Major League Baseball, mentioned that he has been using a mandalart planner since his school days. Inspired by his approach, I decided to create the planner for my goals.

<br />

During search for a suitable platform to create a mandalart planner, I explored various websites on Google. However, despite finding a suitable website, I struggled to fill in all the details as some ideas had yet to come to mind. I planned to revisit and complete the planner later, but unfortunately, the website lacked a feature to save data, offering only an image-saving option. Despite searching for alternative web services or apps, none came to mind.

<br />

I thought that if I have the time, it would be a valuable experience to create a mandalart planner myself later.

## I read Professor Hwang's book, "Immersion."

> After a failed month, the next month comes; after a failed year, the next year follows. However, when it comes to a failed life, there's no 'next life', therefore there’s no way to take solace. A miserable final year full of regrets, this kind of life was the most desperate thing I could think of. From then on, I began thinking about how to live a life without regrets, and this idea has become the most important topic in my life ever since.

‘A life without regrets’. There was also a similar moment in my life.

<br />

In the late summer night of 2022, while I was walking home after a staff dinner, I was hit by a car that ran a red light. The speed was about 30km/h. As a result of this accident, the skin around my right eye was torn on the asphalt, and I suffered from persistent pain in my neck and waist, requiring over six months of rehabilitation. At the time, fortunately, the injuries and pain weren’t bad enough to significantly impact my daily life, so I didn’t think much about it. But a few days later, I thought about how much worse things could’ve been if the accident had been more serious. It gave me a little chill. Because of the that, I decided to live with the mindset of ‘living a life without regrets’ and ‘staying true to the present moment’

<br />

However, As time goes by, these thoughts gradually began to fade from my memory. I found myself dwelling on things of the past and worrying about things yet to come. In such circumstances, I discovered “A life without regrets” in the book and I was able to remind myself.

<br />

I can’t say I’ve been super productive or tried my best all the time over the past month. Sometimes I spent just thinking about the past, and sometimes I simply rested. But I’m not going to regret and give up, since the past has already disappeared and the future has yet to come.
